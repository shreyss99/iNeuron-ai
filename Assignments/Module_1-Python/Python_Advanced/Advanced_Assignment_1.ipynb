    "Ans) OOP in Python provides the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1) Using the inheritance concept, the code which has been defined in the parentclass can be re-used in the child class\n",
    "        implementation.\n",
    "     2) Using abstraction, the user knows just the required amount of details of the code - what it does. How the \n",
    "        system functions internally is hidden from the user.\n",
    "     3) Using encapsulation, the members can be declared public, private or protected which limits the access to them.\n",
    "        It prevents unwanted access to members from outside world.\n",
    "     4) OOPs provides a logical structure to the code.\n",

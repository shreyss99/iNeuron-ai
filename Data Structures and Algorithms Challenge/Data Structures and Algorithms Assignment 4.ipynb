    "### Q1. What is the divide and conquer strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the divide and conquer approach, firstly a problem is divided into smaller problems, then these smaller problems are solved independently, and then finally the solutions of these smaller problems are combined or merged in order to get a solution for the large or the main problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The divide and Conquer algorithm can be divided into the following three steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide: Divide the original problem into a set of smaller problems or subproblems.\n",
    "- Conquer: Solve every subproblem individually and repeat it i.e., recursively.\n",
    "- Combine: We put together or merge the solutions of the subproblems in order to get the solution for the whole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentals of the Divide and Conquer Strategy:\n",
    "There are two fundamentals of the Divide and Conquer Strategy. Let us a look at them.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Relational Formula: This is something that we generate from the given technique. Once the formula is generated, we apply the Divide and Conquer Strategy.\n",
    "- Stopping Condition: Whenever we break the problem, we must have an idea till when will our program run and what should be the end. So, wherever the base condition of recursion occurs, that condition is called a Stopping Condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Divide and Conquer:\n",
    "- It becomes easy for us to solve the biggest problems. We can lessen the effort that it used to take as it works mainly on dividing the problem into two halves and then solving them recursively.\n",
    "- The memory is efficiently used by the strategy as it does not occupy much space and solves simple subproblems within the memory rather than accessing the slower main memory.\n",
    "- It is much more proficient than the Brute Force technique which is its counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Divide and Conquer:\n",
    "- As most of its algorithms are designed by incorporating recursion, it might require high memory management for proper functioning.\n",
    "- An explicit stack might lead to overusing the space.\n",
    "- There is a chance for the system to crash if the recursion is performed continuously - if it exceeds the stack limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Problems solved using Divide and Conquer:\n",
    "- Binary Searching\n",
    "- Merge Sort\n",
    "- Quick Sort\n",
    "- Finding maximum and minimum numbers in an array\n",
    "- Strassen's matrix multiplication."

    "Ans) Binary search is a more specialized algorithm than sequential search as it takes advantage of data that has been sorted. \n",

    "- It is possible to store elements of different data types inside a list as opposed to array which restricts the data type\n",
    "  must be same for all elements. It means we can store integers, floats, strings, complex numbers, lists etc inside a list.\n",
    "- Another unique feature is that lists are mutable which means that the elements inside a list and be changed/updated.\n",
    "- There are many operations you can perform - add and remove elements, sort, find length and index of elements etc.\n",
    "- We can perform slicing and concatenaton of list elements as well.\n",
    "- The implication of iterations is time-consuming in the list.\n",
    "- Operations like insertion and deletion are better performed.\n",
    "- Consumes more memory.\n",
    "- Many built-in methods are available.\n",
    "- Unexpected errors and changes can easily occur in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) TUPLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to a list, a tuple is another built-in data type but differs in two things. \n",
    "- Firstly, tuples are immutable; once you define values in a tuple, you cannot make any changes. \n",
    "- Secondly, we use () to define the set of values in a tuple.\n",

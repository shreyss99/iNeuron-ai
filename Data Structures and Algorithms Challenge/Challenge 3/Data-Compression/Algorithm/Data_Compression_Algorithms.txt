Q) What is Data Compression?

Data Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than a decoded representation would use through the use of specific encoding schemes.


Q) Why do we need Data Compression ?

Compression is needed because it helps to reduce the consumption of expensive resources such as a hard disk or transmission bandwidth. As an uncompressed text or multimedia (speech, image, or video) data requires a huge amount of bits to represent them and thus require large bandwidth.

- What is Data Compression?

Data Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than a decoded representation would use through the use of specific encoding schemes.


- Why do we need Data Compression ?

Compression is needed because it helps to reduce the consumption of expensive resources such as a hard disk or transmission bandwidth. As an uncompressed text or multimedia (speech, image, or video) data requires a huge amount of bits to represent them and thus require large bandwidth.


- Types of Compression Techniques:

A) Lossless:

- In this, the redundant information contained in the data is removed.
- Due to the removal of such information, there is no loss of the data of interest.
- If the data has been losslessly compressed, the original data can be recovered exactly from the compressed data.

B) Lossy:

- There is a loss of information in a controlled manner.
- The lossy compression is therefore not completely reversible.
- But the advantage of this type is higher compression ratios than the lossless compression.

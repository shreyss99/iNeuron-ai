(A) What is Data Compression?

Data Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than a decoded representation would use through the use of specific encoding schemes.


(B) Why do we need Data Compression ?

Compression is needed because it helps to reduce the consumption of expensive resources such as a hard disk or transmission bandwidth. 
As an uncompressed text or multimedia (speech, image, or video) data requires a huge amount of bits to represent them and thus require large bandwidth.


(C) Types of Compression Techniques:

	1) Lossless:

	- In this, the redundant information contained in the data is removed.
	- Due to the removal of such information, there is no loss of the data of interest.	
	- If the data has been losslessly compressed, the original data can be recovered exactly from the compressed data.

	2) Lossy:

	- There is a loss of information in a controlled manner.
	- The lossy compression is therefore not completely reversible.
	- But the advantage of this type is higher compression ratios than the lossless compression.
	

(D) Measuring Performance of Compression Algorithms:

A way of measuring how well a compression algorithm compresses a given set of data is to look at the ratio of the number of bits required to represent the data before compression
and the number of bits required to represent the data after compression. This ratio is called the compression ratio.

Compression ration = (size of uncompressed file) / (size of compressed file)

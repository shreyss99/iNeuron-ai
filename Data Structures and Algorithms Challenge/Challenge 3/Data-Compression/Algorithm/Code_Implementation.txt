(E) Implementation of Compression Algorithms:
	
	1) LZW:  
	  
		Pseudocde:
		
		1     Initialize table with single character strings
		2     P = first input character
		3     WHILE not end of input stream
		4          C = next input character
		5          IF P + C is in the string table
		6            P = P + C
		7          ELSE
		8            output the code for P
		9          add P + C to the string table
		10           P = C
		11         END WHILE
		12    output code for P 
	   
	   
		Implementation:
		
		1) We have used DICTIONARY data structure to store the characters and their corresponding ASCII value from range 0 to 255.
		2) We have used a LIST data structure for storing the codes of the data to be compressed.
		3) We run a loop till data length

FILE MANIPULATION ALGORITHM:

1) In this application, we will be performing the 4 operations:
   - Searching a file in a given path
   - Sorting files in a given path
   - Segregating files based on file extensions and grouping them
   - Merging files in a given path based on file extension
   
2) SEARCHING:
   - For search files in a given path, we ask the user for extension based search or file name based search as criteria.
   - We use the LIST data structure for storing the list of files matching the criteria.
   - The extension based search makes use of glob (global) module which uses STRING data structure just like regex.
   - The file name based search makes use of walk method using TREE data structure. It generates the file names in a directory TREE by walking the TREE either top-down or bottom-up. 
	 For each directory in the TREE rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).

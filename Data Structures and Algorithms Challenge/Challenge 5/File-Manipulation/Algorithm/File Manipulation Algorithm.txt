FILE MANIPULATION ALGORITHM:

1) In this application, we will be performing the 4 operations:
   - Searching a file in a given path
   - Sorting files in a given path
   - Segregating files based on file extensions and grouping them
   - Merging files in a given path based on file extension
   
   
2) SEARCHING:
   - For search files in a given path, we ask the user for extension based search or file name based search as criteria.
   - We use the LIST data structure for storing the list of files matching the criteria.
   - The extension based search makes use of glob (global) module which uses STRING data structure just like regex.
   - The file name based search makes use of walk method using TREE data structure. It generates the file names in a directory TREE by walking the TREE either top-down or bottom-up. 
	For each directory in the TREE rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).


3) SORTING:
   - For sorting files in a given path, we ask the user for sorting based on file name, file size or file modified time as criteria.
   - We use the LIST data structure for storing the list of files in order after sorting process.
   - We use the glob (global) module which uses STRING data structure just like regex.
   - For file name based sort, we sort them according to the file names alphabetically using glob.
   - For file size and file time based sort, the files are filtered by the above process.
    The sorting in LIST happens using the key based on the file size and the modified time stamp in ascending order.

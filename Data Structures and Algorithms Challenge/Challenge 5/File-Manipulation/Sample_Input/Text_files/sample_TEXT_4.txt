The reading passage provide a brief idea into the differentiation of students into grades on the basis of age, its characterstics and normal durations. On the contrary, the lecture does not support the idea provided n the reading passage based on the below reasons.

To start with, the reading passage introduces the point that students which do not meet the curriculum critera for a specific year need to mandatorily repeat the entire year. But the lecture contradicts this idea by saying that it is possible that a student might have just not fared well in a single subject ans is still asked to repeat the entire year. 

As per the reading passage, it is asssumed that the all the students enrolled for a same grade have similar acumen and skills to fare well. On the other hand, it is rightly suggested by the lecture that it is possible to hava an eclectic class of students who may not have the same level of mental, social and physical maturity or readiness for that class.

The lecture highlights a critical point which states that the graded schools test the intelligence of students based on standardised tests which is applicable to the entire group. The results of the tests point out the behaviour of the entire group and often neglects the individual evaluation.

The passage does not take into account the disparity in the levels of understanding and time taken by students to grasp knowledge. Often in graded school classes, there is disparity may be some students who may require more time to pick up lessons and may need to repeat material, whereas there are also those students who have sharp brains leading to them waiting for new lessons to be provided.

To sum up, the reading passage provides a holistic view of the graded school and the lecture joits down the problems associated with the graded school structure.

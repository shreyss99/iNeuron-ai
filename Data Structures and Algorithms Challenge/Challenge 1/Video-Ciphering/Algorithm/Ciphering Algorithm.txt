VIDEO CIPHERING ALGORITHM:

1) In this assignment, we have taken an approach for developing an easy-to-understand algorithm for Video Ciphering.

2) Firstly, after the user inputs the video filename, we capture the details of the video and its frames per second using OpenCV function.

3) If the video is correctly read, we obtain its frame and store it - using loops, we keep on breaking the video into images until the video does not end and store these frames for encryption.

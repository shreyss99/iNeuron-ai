VIDEO CIPHERING ALGORITHM:

1) In this assignment, we have taken an approach for developing an easy-to-understand algorithm for Video Ciphering.

2) Firstly, after the user inputs the video filename, we capture the details of the video and its frames per second using OpenCV function.

3) If the video is correctly read, we obtain its frame and store it - using loops, we keep on breaking the video into images until the video does not end and store these frames for encryption.

4) The stores images are still colored and then we convert them to grayscale images.

5) We then convert the image to a 2-D ARRAY of float32 values and divide the pixel intensity by 255.0 to keep it between 0 and 1.

6) Calculate the dimensions of this image in terms of array rows and columns - width and height.

7) We initialise mean and standard deviation variables to 0.0 and 0.4 - After multiple trials we have chosen the standard deviation value to 0.4 for encryption to hide th image contents, yet give a slight idea what it may represent.

8) We use 2-D ARRAYS to perform arithmetic calculation and generate the encryption key.

9) The size of the 2-D ARRAY is same as the size of the image.

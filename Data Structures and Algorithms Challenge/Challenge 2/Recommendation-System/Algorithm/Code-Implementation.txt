The Recommender System as been implemented using the basic Pthon data structures of NUMPY ARRAYS and PANDAS DATAFRAMES.

1) We first load the Netflix dataset which consists of the Customer ID and the rating given to the movie.

2) Along with this we import the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries.

3) We then obtain the proportion of the ratings from (1 to 5) and group it rating-wise. Based on this we plot a horizontal ba chart to visualise it.
	
4) We see that the score tends to be relatively positive (> 3). 
   This may be because unhappy customers tend to just leave instead of making an effort to rate. 
   We can keep this in mind that low-rating movies mean theyâ€™re generally really bad.
   
   
DATA PREPARATION:

5) The Movie ID column is not proper. We improve this by first creating an array with the correct length, then adding the entire array as a column in the main dataframe.
   We achieve this by using NumPy ARRAY data structure and add this to the Pandas DATAFRAME.
   
6) The dataset is super huge. Therefore, we need to reduce the data volume by improving data quality.

7) We can use these two approaches:

   - Delete the movie with too many reviews (they are relatively unpopular)
   - Remove the customer who gives too less notice (relatively less active)
   
8) We have decided on a threshold value for ignoring the above entries - 80% quantile value.

9) Based on the count and mean metrics we group by the movies and customers.

10) Using the 80% quantile value of the count, we discard all the movies with count less than the threshold value.

11) Once done, we drop the discarded values from the original dataset to obtain a smaller and more strong dataset.

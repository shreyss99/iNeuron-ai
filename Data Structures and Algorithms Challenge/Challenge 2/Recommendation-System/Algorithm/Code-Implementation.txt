The Recommender System as been implemented using the basic Pthon data structures of NUMPY ARRAYS and PANDAS DATAFRAMES.

1) We first load the Netflix dataset which consists of the Customer ID and the rating given to the movie.

2) Along with this we import the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries.

3) We then obtain the proportion of the ratings from (1 to 5) and group it rating-wise. Based on this we plot a horizontal ba chart to visualise it.
	
4) We see that the score tends to be relatively positive (> 3). 
   This may be because unhappy customers tend to just leave instead of making an effort to rate. 
   We can keep this in mind that low-rating movies mean theyâ€™re generally really bad.
